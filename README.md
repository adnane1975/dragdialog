One recent challenge I was proud to overcome was implementing a MUI Dialog with three distinct behaviors:

- External Control: Opening and closing the dialog from an external control.
- Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Allowing users to drag the dialog by its title.
- Non-Modal Behavior: Clicking outside the dialog doesnâ€™t close it, enabling interaction with the backdrop.

You can find more details about the Dialog component [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnane1975/dragdialog.git
yarn
yarn dev

```

and then : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
