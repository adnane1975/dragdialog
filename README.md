This is a code snippet demonstrating the use of the Dialog component from Material-UI (MUI) in React, showcasing these three features:

- Opening and closing the dialog from outside.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for the dialog (drag from the dialog title).
- Non-modal behavior: clicking outside the dialog does not close it, allowing you to interact with the backdrop.

You can find more details about the Dialog component [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/).
